# JLLuaVM

A Java project to read an LUA file and compile it with LLVM's JIT compilation system for high speed execution

JLLuaVM is using [JavaCPP's LLVM bindings](<https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/helloworld/llvm>) to interface with LLVM, since the LWJGL bindings don't even work on windows, and I work on stuff on a windows device

# JLLuaVM IS HEAVILY WIP, AND IS NOT CURRENTLY USABLE
